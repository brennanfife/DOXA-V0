It's a widely known fact that Americans love to play the lottery. In 2017, the country spent roughly $75 billion dollars on lottery tickets, yet you are more likely to be struck by lightning and eaten by a shark ON THE SAME DAY, then win a MegaMillion jackpot. 

According to data drawn by [Vox](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/1/13/10763268/lottery-poor-prey), the people who are holding up this industry are those who are lower class, minorities, and often addicts of the game. Stated in the article, "the poorest third of households buy half of all lotto tickets, according to a Duke University study in the 1980s, in part because lotteries are advertised most aggressively in poorer neighborhoods. A North Carolina report from NC Policy Watch found that the people living in the poorest counties buy the most tickets. 'Out of the 20 counties with poverty rates higher than 20 percent, 18 had lottery sales topping the statewide average of $200 per adult,' the North Carolina Justice Center reported."

With most lottery tickets being bought in poor neighborhoods, in places with more minorities, and those ultimately in financial trouble, we sought to help find a solution with DOXA, a [prize-linked savings account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account). Through DOXA, users will be increntived to save money by generating lottery games through the interest that is generated on the savings account.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
